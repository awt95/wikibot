\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I want to take this opportunity to thank my family and my partner, for their continued support not only during this project, but throughout my whole higher education journey. I am grateful for their unconditional support through the challenges I have faced during my studies.

I also want to thank my project supervisor, Steve Wesemeyer, for his continued support throughout this project. His guidance and feedback has been invaluable for the success of this project.
