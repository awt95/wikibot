\subsection{Performance Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item P1: Web page loads in 5 seconds
	\item P2: Chatbot response in 5 seconds
	\item P3: Application functions without failure
	\item P4: Any errors are logged and the user is informed of an error
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsec:requirementresults}

\section{Unit Testing}

\section{User Acceptance Testing}
Although we have tested the requirements specification, it is important that we assess the accuracy and ability of the system as a whole. For example, we may get a response from the system, but it may not be the result we were expecting. As such, the three testers will be given access to the system in order to answer many unseen questions and assess their output.

In order to formalise this, the users were asked to document the exact query they entered, the result they received, and whether or not it was the result they were expecting, in line with the questions in the specification. They were also asked to ask it further questions beyond the scope of the specification, so that we can establish logical future developments for the system. The format of their testing results is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Test Number
	\item Requirement (F\#)
	\item Input
	\item Output
	\item Result as expected?
	\item Comments
\end{itemize}
They were asked to test at least 5 queries for each requirement item, followed by at least 10 queries not related to the requirements, and document their results with comments. For anonymity, each user's results are shown in Figures~ with a user number.
